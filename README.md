# Mini-Data-Science-Projects
Repository for small data science projects. May be just some fun dataset I wanted to explore. Projects here are usually small enough to be within 1 Jupyter or R notebook only.

Contents:
- Liquid Studio Tech Challenge - dataset containing all flights in/out of Brazil in 2017, and trying to answer a number of interesting questions regarding the busiest cities, touristic cities and also an attempt to at a simple solution for the travelling salesman problem.
- Australian Bureau of Statistics analysis
